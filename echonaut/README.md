This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev   <---- When in directory, just type this and should start locally
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Instructions for git

# Branch navigation
git branch - to see the branches on your local machine
git checkout [branch-name] - to go to the branch
git checkout -b [branch-name] - to make a new branch locally

# Add, Commit, and push
git add . - adds all filles
git add [ file directory ] - adds specific files

git commit -m "[commit message]" - commit after add

git push - push from local branch to remote branch

# Pulling from different branch into current branch

git checkout [current branch name]   - gets you "on branch dmgr2"
git fetch origin        - gets you up to date with origin
git merge origin/ [Where you are merging from]  -updates your current directory with code you are taking from


## Instructions for Github

1. We will work on different features, each feature will be on a different branch. 
2. Any changes to files should be in their respective branches if possible to make it more organized.
3. Before merging finished changes to main, we should discuss or at least give each other a heads up about the changes so we can stay on the same track
4. If the freature is good to go make a pull request on Github, try not to commit directly into main, keeps it safe and organized
